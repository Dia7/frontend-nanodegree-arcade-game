Files:
* `index.html`: loads style and js 
* `css/styles.css`
* `js` folder: handles all the game logic.Has 3 files:
    - resources.js
    - engine.js
    - app.js
    
 ## Instructions
Use the arrow keys to move the player. The player should avoid the bugs, crossing the canvas, because the collisions are deadliest and they take lives (hearts). The player has 3 lives. The game ends when the player loses all 3 lives. If the player manage to reach the water aria 5 times - he/she wins the game.
 
 ## Basic functionality
 There are two game objects - `Enemy` class and `Player` class. All the required methods are implemented on the Prototype objects of the classes.
